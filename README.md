## config

This directory contains configuration files for coding agents and skills. Each file includes predefined rules, descriptions, and settings to help streamline the setup and usage of various coding agents and skills.

### Files

- `.claude/CLAUDE.md`: Configuration for the Claude coding agent, including foundational rules, relationship guidelines, and coding standards.
- `.gemini/GEMINI.md`: Configuration for the Gemini coding agent, detailing operational parameters, ethical constraints, and technical standards for the Orion AI collaborator.
- `.guides/I18N.md`: Guide for implementing internationalization (i18n) in Next.js applications using the `next-intl` library, including setup instructions, translation file structure, and usage examples.
- `.guides/SECURITY.md`: Security best practices for Next.js applications, covering CORS configuration, XSS prevention, and Content Security Policy (CSP) implementation.
- `.guides/DEPENDENCIES.md`: (Not shown in snippets) Presumably a guide for managing dependencies in Bun/Node.js projects, including package updates and version conflict resolution.
- `.guides/DEBUGGING.md`: (Not shown in snippets) Presumably a guide for systematic debugging techniques, root cause analysis, and debugging processes.
- `.guides/API_INTEGRATION.md`: (Not shown in snippets) Presumably a guide for integrating APIs, including error handling, retries, rate limiting, and caching strategies.
- `.guides/ACCESSIBILITY.md`: (Not shown in snippets) Presumably a guide for ensuring accessibility (a11y) compliance, including WCAG standards, ARIA usage, keyboard navigation, and considerations for 3D/spatial content.

### Usage

To utilize these configurations, copy the desired file into your coding agent or skill's configuration directory.

### Customization

Feel free to modify the configurations to better suit your workflow and project requirements. Ensure that any changes align with your overall coding standards and practices.
